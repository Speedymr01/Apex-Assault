## Vision

- Enemies that spawn in a 3 tile radius of corresponding spawner.
- Enemies have 2 types of attack, melee and ranged.
- In the bottom room, the intended mechanic is that both buttons must be pressed to open the next door.
- In the T hallway only one button (random) will open the door, the other will spawn enemies in the room, and you may die.
